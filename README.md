# Great things are coming
This project was initially designed to deploy a streamlit frontend PoC for a custom LangChain orchestrated RAG system. Due to various limitations, it has been converted into an ongoing experimentation lab for LLM orchestration libraries.

The following use-cases have been identified (as of now): 
1. LangChain orchestrated RAG system deployed with StreamLit frontend.  
2. LlamaIndex orchestrated RAG systems deployed with ChainLit frontend.
3. Evaluation pipeline for baseline RAG system with LlamaIndex.
4. Evaluation of document retrieval methodologies (HyDE and sub-question query decomposition).
